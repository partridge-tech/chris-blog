Hi, I'm Chris, a ~~basement-dweller~~ ~~eboy~~ cybersecurity fella on the internet.

Currently, I'm working on Cloud Security @ [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us) as part of the Proactive Security department. My notable past roles include:
- Security Engineer, Vulnerability Management @ [Luta Security](https://www.lutasecurity.com/) on the [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) contract
- Product Security Engineer @ [Datto](https://datto.com), and Software Engineer before that

In my spare time, I am also involved in [Machines Never Sleep, LLC](https://mns.llc/), a cybersecurity research & development company I founded.
